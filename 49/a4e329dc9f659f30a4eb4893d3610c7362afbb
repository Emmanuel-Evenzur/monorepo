Important changes:

  - In the future, Bazel will expand tree artifacts in runfiles, too,
    which causes the sandbox to link each file individually into the
    sandbox directory, instead of symlinking the entire directory. In
    this release, the behavior is not enabled by default yet. Please
    try it out via
    --incompatible_symlinked_sandbox_expands_tree_artifacts_in_runfile
    s_tree and let us know if it causes issues. If everything looks
    good, this behavior will become the default in a following
    release.
