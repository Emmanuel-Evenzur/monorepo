Incompatible changes:

  - Tree artifacts and regular artifact paths can no longer overlap.

New features:

  - Added a special "_validation" output group to enable moving
    "validation actions" off the critical path of builds.

Important changes:

  - The query flag "--host_deps" (commonly used as "--nohost_deps")
    has been renamed to "--tool_deps", and now also removes
    dependencies in any execution configuration from being reported
    in the query output. The previous flag name is deprecated and
    will be removed in a future release.
  - The `cc_common.{compile,link}` APIs can now be used without
    passing the `--experimental_cc_skylark_api_enabled_packages` flag.
  - A list of log paths will be provided in build output.
  - Improve runfiles documentation.
  - Improve documentation on rule outputs.
  - BUILD/.bzl execution errors cause execution to stop, even at
    top-level
  - Multiple Starlark validation errors are reported in a single pass.
  - Introduce --experimental_nested_set_as_skykey_threshold
  - Blaze will prevent idle sleep during test and build actions. Note
    that this does not affect screen savers and will not keep a
    laptop awake if the user forces sleep or closes the lid. This is
    purely to avoid idle sleeping when the user is not interacting
    with the device.
  - Improve testing docs.
  - Incompatible flag
    `--incompatible_validate_top_level_header_inclusions` has been
    added. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10047 for
    details.
  - Fix an aquery bug with handling malformed queries that crashes
    bazel.
  - List fields on CcLinkingOutputs.
  - [Python] Added flag --incomaptible_default_to_explicit_init_py to
    switch the default value of legacy_create_init to True. With this
    flag enabled, your py_binary and py_test targets will no longer
    behave as if empty __init__.py files were implicitly littered in
    your runfiles tree. See
    [#10076](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10076).
  - Fix documentation on allowed target names.
  - --target_platform_fallback now also applies to exec/host
    configurations
  - android_binary and android_libary can now depend on targets
    providing
    CcInfos.
  - Add support for tracking suspensions (sleeps or SIGSTOP) on macOS.
  - d8 dexers (both standalone and incremental) are now available for
    use.
  - Add Desugar support for FreezePeriod#<init>
