New features:

  - Add inputs filtering for aquery
  - https://docs.bazel.build now supports versioned
    documentation. Use the selector at the top of the navigation bar
    to
    switch between documentation for different Bazel releases.
  - build_tar.py in tools/build_defs/pkg now supports a json manifest
    that can be used to add paths that have symbols that can't be
    specified via the command line

Important changes:

  - Added `--incompatible_dont_emit_static_libgcc`
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6825)
    Added `--incompatible_linkopts_in_user_link_flags`
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6826)
  - mobile-install now works with aapt2. Try it out with `bazel
    mobile-install --android_aapt=aapt2 //my:target`
  - Fixed a mobile-install v1 bug when deploying to Android 9 Pie
    devices. https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6814
  - Add a new option --xbinary_fdo to pass xbinary profile.
  - --runs_per_test: place in TESTING documentation category.
  - Adds a clarifying message to test case summary output when all
    test cases pass but the target fails.
  - Fixed mobile-install v1 error when installing an app with native
    libraries onto an Android 9 (Pie) device. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/issues/77
  - Fixed issue where error messages from Android manifest merging
    actions were not propagated fully.
  - Add outputs and mnemonic filtering to aquery
  - New incompatible change flag for defaulting to aapt2 in Android
    builds: `--incompatible_use_aapt2_by_default`. To build with
    aapt2 today, pass the flag
    `--incompatible_use_aapt2_by_default=true` or
    `--android_aapt=aapt2`, or set the `aapt_version`  to `aapt2` on
    your `android_binary` or `android_local_test` target.
  - set projectId in all PublishBuildToolEventStreamRequest
  - Flip flag --incompatible_string_is_not_iterable
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5830)
  - cc_toolchain.(static|dynamic)_runtime_libs attributes are now
    optional
  - Added --incompatible_disable_runtimes_filegroups
    (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6942).
  - objc_bundle has been removed. Please migrate to rules_apple's
    [apple_bundle_import](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/bl
    ob/master/doc/rules-resources.md#apple_bundle_import).
  - The apple_stub_binary rule has been deleted.
  - Incompatible flag `--incompatible_dont_emit_static_libgcc` has
    been flipped (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6825)
  - Incompatible flag `--incompatible_linkopts_in_user_link_flags`
    has been flipped (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6826)
  - Open source aquery & cquery query2 tests
  - Fixed a mobile-install bug where `arm64-v8a` libraries were not
    deployed correctly on `arm64` devices. This was done by enabling
    incremental native lib deployment by default. A previously
    undocumented `--android_incremental_native_libs` flag is removed,
    and is now the regular behavior. See
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2239
  - Incompatible flag `--incompatible_linkopts_in_user_link_flags`
    has been flipped (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6826)
  - Incompatible flag `--incompatible_dont_emit_static_libgcc` has
    been flipped (https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6825)
  - Added --incompatible_disable_legacy_crosstool_fields. See the
    migration notes at
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6861.
  - In the Query HowTo, recommend ":*" instead of ":all". "all" might
    be the name of a target.
