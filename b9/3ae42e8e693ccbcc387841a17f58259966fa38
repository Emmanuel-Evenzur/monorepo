Incompatible changes:

  - Bazel now always runs binaries in with "bazel run" in
    interactive mode. The "--nodirect_run" command line option is now
    a no-op.
  - "bazel run --noas_test" is not supported anymore.
  - Indentation on the first line of a file was previously ignored.
    This is now fixed.

New features:

  - C++,runfiles: to access data-dependencies (runfiles) in C++
    programs, use the runfiles library built into Bazel. For usage
    info, see
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/master/tools/cpp/runfiles
    /runfiles.h

Important changes:

  - Bazel now allows almost all 7-bit ASCII characters in labels.
  - Remove vestigial java_plugin.data attribute
  - Bazel supports including select Java 8 APIs into Android apps
    targeting pre-Nougat Android devices with
    --experimental_desugar_java8_libs
  - Flag `--incompatible_disable_glob_tracking` is removed.
  - SkyQuery's rbuildfiles now returns targets corresponding to
    broken packages.
  - Introduce build support for providing cache prefetch hints.
  - Update the skylark DefaultInfo documentation to spell out
    runfiles, data_runfiles and default_runfiles
  - An internal action for symlinking runfiles will use Command
    instead of a Spawns. This should have no functional chages; the
    only user visible consequence should be that the internal action
    is no longer be included in statistics when calculating processes
    count.
  - --batch is deprecated
  - execution strategies line no longer handles differently the case
    where all processes have the same strategy.
  - The --experimental_remote_spawn_cache flag is now enabled by
    default, and remote caching no longer needs --*_strategy=remote
    flags (it will fail if they are specified).
  - android_binary.aapt_version='aapt2' now supports en_XA and ar_XB
  - Added --apple_enable_auto_dsym_dbg flag.
  - non_propagated_deps has been removed from objc_library and
    apple_binary.
  - For Android projects, Bazel now supports building fonts as
    resources. See
    https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/fonts-in-xml
    for more information on the feature.
  - With --incompatible_no_support_tools_in_action_inputs enabled, Skylark
    action inputs are no longer scanned for tools. Move any such
    inputs to the newly introduced 'tools' attribute.
