Incompatible changes:

  - Remove //tools/defaults:android_jar. Use
    @bazel_tools//tools/android:android_jar instead.
  - The flag --incompatible_show_all_print_messages is removed.
    Messages generated by `print` statements from any package will be
    displayed as
    DEBUG messages.
  - The --incompatible_disallow_uncalled_set_constructor flag is no
    longer available, the `set` constructor` is completely removed
    from Skylark.
    Use `depset` instead.
  - Variables PACKAGE_NAME and REPOSITORY_NAME are deprecated in
    favor of
      functions `package_name()` and `repository_name()`.

    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/native.html#p
    ackage_name
  - BUILD_TIMESTAMP now contains seconds (and not milliseconds) since
    the epoch.

New features:

  - Strings have a new .elems() method, that provides an iterator on
    the characters of the string.
  - Now you can access three functions in windows_cc_configure.bzl by:
      load("@bazel_tools/tools/cpp:windows_cc_configure.bzl",
    "<function_name>")

Important changes:

  - CppRules: Unified action_configs for static libraries
  - Remove support for blaze dump --vfs. It is no longer meaningful.
  - Enable dependency checking for aar_import targets.
  - internal_bootstrap_hack has been deprecated and removed.
  - Properly handle tree artifacts on the link command line coming
    from a cc_library dependency.
  - Allow C++ features to make proto_library emit smaller C++ code
  - The 'j2objc' configuration fragment is exposed to Skylark.
  - Remove the default content of the global bazelrc.
  - In int() function, do not auto-detect base if input starts with
    '0'.
  - Users can now pass --experimental_shortened_obj_file_path=true to
    have a shorter object file path, the object file paths (and all
    other related paths) will be constructed as following:
    If there's no two or more source files with the same base name:

    <bazel-bin>/<target_package_path>/_objs/<target_name>/<source_base
    _name>.<extension>
    otherwise:

    <bazel-bin>/<target_package_path>/_objs/<target_name>/N/<source_ba
    se_name>.<extension>
      N = the file?s order among the source files with the same
    basename, starts from 0.
  - Move (c/cxx)opts from legacy_compile_flags to user_compile_flags
  - CppRules: Remove optional_*_flag fields from CROSSTOOL, they are
    not
    used, and could be expressed using features.
  - Introduce --incompatible_disable_objc_provider_resources to turn
    off all resource-related fields of the Objc provider.
  - Removed the statement of "What does Bazel support?" as it's
    limiting/misleading. Added supported host OSes to
    "multi-platform" paragraph.
  - android_library AAR output now contains proguard.txt
  - Bazel now displays information about remote cache hits and
    execution strategies used in its UI after every build and test,
    and adds a corresponding line "process stats" to BuildToolLogs in
    BEP.
  - Print correct build result for builds with --aspects flag.
  - android_binary.manifest_merger is no longer supported.
