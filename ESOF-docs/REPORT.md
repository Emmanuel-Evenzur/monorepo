## Descrição do Projecto ##

[Bazel] (http://bazel.io/) is an open source project from Google aiming to provide faster _builds_ of software. It is still in _beta_, but the goal is to achieve a stable version in May of 2016. The full detailed roadmap can be checked [here] (http://bazel.io/roadmap.html).
Everyone is welcome to support the project, but it is required to fulfill all the [requirements] (http://bazel.io/contributing.html). The programming language is [Skylark] (http://bazel.io/docs/skylark/concepts.html) which "is a superset of the core build language and its syntax is a subset of Python". When the project finishes, it will support [multiple programming languages] (http://bazel.io/docs/build-encyclopedia.html#Rules) (such as Java or C++). The _BUILD files_ are Python-like scripts. To get started, please check [here] (http://bazel.io/docs/getting-started.html) how to do it.
