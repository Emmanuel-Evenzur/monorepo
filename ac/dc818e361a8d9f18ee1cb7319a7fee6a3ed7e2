  - New bazelrc file list.
  - Adds --incompatible_expand_directories to automatically expand
    directories in skylark command lines. Design doc:

  - --incompatible_package_name_is_a_function now defaults to true.
    The magic values PACKAGE_NAME and REPOSITORY_NAME are no longer
    exposed.

New features:

  - Add --modify_execution_info, a flag to customize action execution
    info.

Important changes:

  - A new, experimental, options --experimental_ui_deduplicate was
    added that
      makes the UI try to deduplicate messages from actions to keep
    the output on the
      console cleaner.
  - Add ExecutionInfo to aquery output for ExecutionInfoSpecifier
    actions.
  - The Android resource processing pipeline now supports persistence
    via worker processes. Enable it with
    `--persistent_android_resource_processor`. We have observed 1.5x
    faster clean local builds, and up to 2.5x faster incremental
    local builds.
  - --windows_exe_launcher is deprecated, this flag will be removed
    soon. Please make sure you are not using it.
  - CppRules: cc_binary link action no longer hardcodes
    -static-libgcc for toolchains that support embedded runtimes
    (guarded by --experimental_dont_emit_static_libgcc temporarily).
  - When computing --instrumentation_filter, end filter patterns with
    "[/:]" to match non-top-level packages exactly and treat
    top-level targets consistently.
  - The startup flag --host_javabase has been renamed to
    --server_javabase to avoid confusion with the build flag
    --host_javabase.
  - objc_library now supports the module_name attribute
  - Added "bazel info server_log" command to obtain the main Bazel
    server
    log file path, which can be quite useful for debugging Bazel
    issues.
  - Support fileset expansion in ctx.actions.args(). Controlled by
    --incompatible_expand_directories.
  - Fixes aapt shrink resources not respecting filters configurations
  - --javacopt= no longer affects compilations of tools that are
    executed during the build; use --host_javacopt= to change javac
    flags in the host configuration.
  - Revert the default of --incompatible_package_name_is_a_function
    to false.
  - Future versions of Bazel will require a locally installed JDK
    for Java development. Previously Bazel would fall back to using
    the
    embedded --server_javabase if no JDK as available. Pass
    --incompatible_never_use_embedded_jdk_for_javabase to disable the
    legacy
    behaviour.
  - Fix regression #6219, remote cache failures
