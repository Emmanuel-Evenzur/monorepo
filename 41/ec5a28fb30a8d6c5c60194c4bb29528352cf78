Incompatible changes:

  - The following attributes of CcToolchainProvider, which formerly
    were
    accessible both as fields (x.f) and as methods (x.f()), are now
    only fields:

New features:

  - Similar to the
    [.bazelignore](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/guide.html
    #.bazelignore) in the main repository, a `.bazelignore` file in
    external repository will cause the specified directories to be
    ignored by Bazel. Bazel won't try to identify any packages under
    the directories, but the files can still be referenced in other
    BUILD files.
  - bazelignore files now support line comments, e.g. "# this is a
    comment"

Important changes:

  - Experimental support for d8 merger is now available for use using
    --define=android_dexmerger_tool=d8_dexmerger.
  - Critical path run time should not have a longer run time than
    total execution run time.
  - Remove "please do not import" warning for cc rules.
  - x.f() is now equivalent to y=x.f; y(). That is, x.f should return
    the same
    attribute value regardless of whether it is accessed as a field
    or called
    like a method. Any arguments to the call are evaluated after the
    x.f operation.
  - Add desugaring support for RoleManager#addRoleHolderAsUser
  - Adds ctx.target_platform_has_constraint to allow rules to check
    the target platform's constraints.
  - Critical path run time should not have a longer run time than
    total execution run time.
  - Post new ConvenienceSymlinksIdentifiedEvent to the
    BuildEventProtocol when
    --experimental_convenience_symlinks_bep_event is enabled.
  - Keyword-only arguments are now allowed:
        def foo(a, *, k): pass
        def foo(a, *b, k): pass
      where k can be specified only by keyword:
        foo(5, k=6)
  - Generated Go protobufs now depend on //net/proto2/go:protodeps in
    addition to //net/proto2/go:proto
  - cquery 'somepath' returns more reliable results when the
    dep has a different configuration than the parent. To get a
    result for
    `somepath(//foo, //bar`) where //bar isn't in the top-level
    configuration,
    run your query with `--universe_scope=//foo`. See cquery docs for
    details.
