Incompatible changes:

  - Loading @bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git_repositories.bzl
    no longer works. Load @bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl
    instead.
  - If the same artifact is generated by two distinct but identical
    actions, and a downstream action has both those actions' outputs
    in its inputs, the artifact will now appear twice in the
    downstream action's inputs. If this causes problems in Skylark
    actions, you can use the uniquify=True argument in Args.add_args.

    unless they are wrapped, e.g: $(location //foo:bar)

  - New bazelrc file list.

New features:

  - The aquery command now supports --output=text.

Important changes:

  - Allow @ in package names.
  - Remove support for java_runtime_suite; use alias() together with
    select() instead.
  - Python wrapper scripts for MSVC are removed.
  - [JavaInfo] Outputs are merged in java_common.merge().
  - Faster analysis by improved parallelization.
  - --experimental_shortened_obj_file_path is removed.
  - Introduce the --remote_cache_proxy flag,
    which allows for remote http caching to connect
    via a unix domain socket.
  - No longer define G3_VERSION_INFO for c++ linkstamp compiles, as
    it was a duplicate of G3_TARGET_NAME.
  - Added support for Android NDK r17. The default STL is now
    `libc++`, and support for targeting `mips`, `mips64` and `ARMv5`
    (`armeabi`) has been removed.
  - Add aquery command to get analysis time information about the
    action graph.
  - Fixed compatibility with aar_import when using aapt2.  AAPT2 is
    now supported for Android app builds without resource shrinking.
    To use it, pass the `--android_aapt=aapt2` flag or define
    android_binary.aapt_version=aapt2.
  - Code coverage is collected for Java binaries invoked from sh_test.
  - java_common.compile creates the native headers jar accesible via
    JavaInfo.outputs.native_headers.
  - Deleting deprecated no-op flag --show_package_location
  - The JDK shipped with Bazel was updated to JDK10.
  - Rename the startup flag --host_javabase to --server_javabase to
    avoid confusion with the build flag --host_javabase
  - newly added options --experimental_repository_hash_file and
      --experimental_verify_repository_rules allow to verify for
    repositories
      the directory generated against pre-recorded hashes. See
    documentation
      for those options.
  - Removed the gen_jars output group
  - --subcommands can now take a "pretty_print" value
    ("--subcommands=pretty_print") to print the
    arguments of subcommands as a list for easier reading.
  - follow-up to
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/1ac359743176e659e9c7472
    645e3142f3c44b9e8
  - A rule error is now thrown if a Skylark rule implementation
    function returns multiple providers of the same type.
  - When using Bazel's remote execution feature and Bazel has to
    fallback to local execution for an action, Bazel used
    non-sandboxed
    local execution until now. From this release on, you can use the
    new
    flag --remote_local_fallback_strategy=<strategy> to tell Bazel
    which
    strategy to use in that case.
  - Execution Log Parser can now, when printing it out, filter the
    log by runner type
  - A rule error is now thrown if a Skylark rule implementation
    function returns multiple providers of the same type.
  - Removed the gen_jars output group
  - Removed the gen_jars output group
