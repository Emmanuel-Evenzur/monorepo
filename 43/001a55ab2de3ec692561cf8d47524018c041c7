Incompatible changes:

  - The deprecated `set` constructor is removed, along with the
    migration flag --incompatible_disallow_set_constructor. It is
    still temporarily
    allowed to refer to `set` from within unexecuted code.
  - The flag --incompatible_disallow_set_constructor is no longer
    available, the deprecated `set` constructor is not available
    anymore.
  - The path to the JVM executable is not accessible anymore as
    ctx.{fragments,host_fragments}.jvm.java_executable. Use
    JavaRuntimeInfo.java_executable_exec_path instead.
  - --clean_style is no longer an option.

New features:

  - Users can use win_def_file attribute to specify a DEF file for
    exporting symbols when build a shared library on Windows.
  - Add --experimental_android_resource_cycle_shrinking option to
    allow for more aggressive code and resource shrinking.

Important changes:

  - Late-bound attributes are exposed to skylark. This is a new API
    (`configuration_field()`) to depend on certain
    configuration-defined targets from skylark rules.
  - Document interaction between test_suite and target exclusions
  - AAR manifest files will come from the processed resource APK if it
    exists.
    RELNOTES: None for Blaze users.
  - Document interaction between test_suite and target exclusions
  - --keep_incrementality_data flag allows Bazel servers to be run in
    memory-saving non-incremental mode independent of --batch and
    --discard_analysis_cache.
  - Add deps attribute to Skylark maven_aar and maven_jar workspace
    rules.
  - Use --expand_configs_in_place as a startup argument to change the
    order in which --config expansions are interpreted.
  - SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
    (https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/) can
    be used to override the timestamp used for stamped target (when
    using --stamp).
  - Package specifications can now be prefixed with `-` to indicate
    negation
  - transitive_source_jars is now exposed on JavaInfo.
  - Add six to deps of has_services=1 py_proto_librarys.
  - java_tests no complain when use_testrunner is explicitly set to 1
    and main_class is set.
  - transitive_source_jars is now exposed on JavaInfo.
  - Debug messages generated by `print()` are not being filtered out
    by --output_filter anymore, it's recommended not to use them in
    production code.
  - in the Label() function, relative_to_caller_repository is now
    deprecated.
  - java_tests no complain when use_testrunner is explicitly set to 1
    and main_class is set.
  - Bazel's default hash function was changed from MD5 to SHA256.
    In particular, this affects users of remote caching and
    execution, as
    all hashes will be SHA256 by default.
  - Remove redirects for domains be.bazel.build and cr.bazel.build
    from the source for docs.bazel.build (because those subdomains
    don't resolve here; they resolve to bazel.build, which has the
    redirects for them)
  - First argument of 'load' must be a label. Path syntax is removed.
      (label should start with '//' or ':').
  - Document startup option --host_javabase
  - The --host_platform and --platform flags are no longer
    experimental.
