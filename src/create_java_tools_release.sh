# A script that creates java_tools release candidates or release artifacts.
#
# Before creating a release candidate the script assumes that the java_tools
# binaries pipeline was previously run and generated java_tools artifacts at
# a commit hash.
#
# The script is using gsutil to copy artifacts.
#
# Mandatory flags:
# --java_version        The JDK version included in the java_tools to be
                        released.
# --java_tools_version  The version number of the java_tools to be released.
# --rc                  The release candidate number of current release.
#                       If --release true then --rc is the number of the rc to
#                       be released.
#                       If --release false then --rc is the number of the rc to
#                       be created.
# --release             "true" if the script has to create the release artifact
#                       or "false" if the script has to create a release
#                       candidate.
# --commit_hash         The commit hash where the java_tools binaries pipeline
#                       was run. Mandatory only if --release false.
#
# Usage examples:
#
# To create the first release candidate for a new java_tools version 2.1 and
# JDK11, that was built at commit_hash 123456:
#
# src/create_java_tools_release.sh --commit_hash 123456 \
#     --java_tools_version 2.1 --java_version 11 --rc 1 --release false
#
# To release the release candidate created above:
#
# src/create_java_tools_release.sh \
#     --java_tools_version 2.1 --java_version 11 --rc 1 --release true
