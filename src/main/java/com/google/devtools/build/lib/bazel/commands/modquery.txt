Usage: %{product} %{command} [<option> ...] <query_type> [<args> ...]

Queries the Bzlmod external dependency graph.

<query_type> [<args> ...] can be one of:
    - deps <module>:
                      Prints the direct dependencies of the target module(s).
    - transitiveDeps <module>:
                      Prints all the (resolved) transitive dependencies of the
                      target module(s).
    - all_paths <module_from> <module_to>:
                      Prints all paths in the dependency graph from
                      <module_from> to <module_to>.
    - path <module_from> <module_to>:
                      Prints the shortest path found in the dependency graph
                      from <module_from> to <module_to>.
    - explain <module>:
                      Prints all the places where the target module is (or was)
                      requested as a direct dependency, along with the reason
                      why the respective final version was selected.

<module> arguments must be of type:
     - root           The current (root) module you are inside of.
     - <name>@<version>
     - <name>@_       For specifying the empty version (for non-registry
                      overridden modules).
     - <name>         Can also be used only in the case where a single version
                      is present. Exceptionally, <name> can be used for the
                      'explain' query as a placeholder for all the present
                      versions of the module <name>.

NOTE: This command is still very experimental and the precise semantics
will change in the near future.
