/**
 * A Builder consumes an Action graph, and executes it in some topological
 * order, possibly concurrently, using some dependency-checking policy.
 *
 * <p> The methods of the Builder interface are typically long-running, but
 * honour the {@link java.lang.Thread#interrupt} contract: if an interrupt is
 * delivered to the thread in which a call to buildTargets or buildArtifacts is
 * active, the Builder attempts to terminate the call prematurely, throwing
 * InterruptedException.  No guarantee is made about the timeliness of such
 * termination, as it depends on the ability of the Actions being executed to
 * be interrupted, but typically any running subprocesses will be quickly
 * killed.

   * @param executor an opaque application-specific value that will be
   *        passed down to the execute() method of any Action executed during
   *        this call.
   * @param modifiedFileSet the modified source files.
   * @param builtArtifacts (out) set of successfully built artifacts. Can be

   * @throws InterruptedException if there was an asynchronous stop request.
   * @throws TestExecException if any test fails
