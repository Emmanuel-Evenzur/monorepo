/**
 * A persistent in-memory cache to store the last seen modification time of
 * artifacts. It also serves the purpose of determining whether a build is
 * incremental or not based on the top-level artifacts to be built.
 *
 * <p>This class' correctness is conditional on the previous build having been called on
 * the same set of root artifacts, with Blaze not having been shut down or otherwise cleared
 * in the meantime. Given these conditions, it can be asserted that the only actions needing
 * to be executed are those that are marked as not having succeeded last run, or that have a
 * modified input. A modified input is an artifact that either had its generating action
 * re-executed for whatever reason, or has its mtime (as given by a stat) different
 * than the one cached from the previous build, or was detected as modified in the previous
 * build, but whose dependent actions were not successfully marked as stale in that build
 * (presumably because the build was interrupted before that stage). See documentation of
 * {@link DependentActionGraph#staleActions} for more details on this last case.
