/**
 * An implementation of DependencyChecker and extension of the
 * DatabaseDependencyChecker. This class differs from its superclass in the way
 * it determines if an action needs to be executed in the course of a build.
 *
 * <p>The IncrementalDependencyChecker uses information cached by the
 * ArtifactMTimeCache to avoid doing checks to the action cache unless
 * needed. By knowing the last modification times of artifacts from the previous
 * build, and by constructing a dependency graph, this class can mark artifacts
 * as "dirty" if their mtime changed and propagate this status to any artifacts
 * depending on a dirty one. The dirty state signals that an action may need
 * to be re-run due to changed inputs or outputs, not that it will necessarily
 * be executed. On the other hand, a non-dirty action does not need to be
 * re-executed.
 *
 * <p>Note: the correctness of the results is dependent on the build being
 * executed being incremental, as defined by the {@code isApplicableToBuild}
 * method of the ArtifactMTimeCache class. Namely, the current top-level
 * artifacts requested to build need to be the same as the artifacts of the
 * previous build. The correctness also depends on all actions in the action
 * cache that reference any artifact having the same metadata cached for that
 * artifact. In other words, if any artifacts were externally modified in the
 * previous build such that different actions saw different file metadata, the
 * correctness of the IncrementalDependencyChecker on those files is not guaranteed.
