  /*
   * Signals and Interrupts
   * ======================
   *
   * The handling of signals is somewhat complex.  Here is the sequence of
   * events that occurs when the user types Control-C or otherwise sends SIGINT
   * to a Blaze process. This only describes interruptions in the execution
   * phase. Interruptions in the loading phase are described in
   * LabelVisitor.java .
   *
   * (1) User types Control-C.  Terminal delivers SIGINT to all processes in
   *      the foreground process-group.  In batch mode, this is the Blaze JVM
   *      and any subprocesses forked by currently-running actions.  In
   *      client/server mode, this just the Blaze client process, which passes
   *      it on to just the Blaze JVM.
   *
   * (2)  JVM's schedules special signal handling thread to run the
   *      application's SIGINT handler.
   *
   * It is not defined in which order the various processes respond to signal
   * delivery, and in client/server mode, the subprocesses won't receive any
   * signal from terminal Therefore there are two possible sequences of events
   * at this point, (a) and (b).
   *
   * (3a) The Java signal handler runs, and posts an interrupt to the
   *      application's main thread, in which the Builder runs.
   *
   * (4a) If the Builder is not blocked, i.e. it's visiting targets and doing
   *      dependency checking, then it may poll its thread's interrupted
   *      status, and iff interrupted, throws an InterruptedException up to
   *      the caller (but see note 6 below).  More often than not, however,
   *      the builder is blocked waiting for the ExecutionService.
   *
   * (5a) If the Builder is blocked in ExecutionService.take(), that wait is
   *      aborted and throws an InterruptedException, which is caught, causing
   *      the ExecutionService to be shut down, posting an interrupt
   *      to each worker-thread in its pool.
   *
   *      If the actions being executed by each worker-thread support
   *      interruptibility, they will exit early; otherwise they will run to
   *      completion.  (Notably, io.base.shell.Command does support
   *      early-termination when interrupted.  It doesn't throw
   *      InterruptedException, though; it merely preserves the worker-thread's
   *      interrupted status.)
   *
   *      Any job failures during shutdown will be quietly ignored.
   *      Once the ExecutionService shutown is complete, the
   *      InterruptedException is re-thrown up to the caller.
   *
   * If the Java signal handler does not run in a timely manner (as often
   * happens), one or more of the subprocesses forked by currently-executing
   * actions will fail due to the SIGINT.  In that case:
   *
   * (3b) One or more of the subprocesses fails due to SIGINT, causing the
   *      io.base.shell.Command (typically) to fail, and thence the execution
   *      of the action to fail.  The action then raises an
   *      ActionExecutionException. This is handled just like a normal action
   *      failure, causing the ParallelBuilder to either immediately rethrow
   *      the ActionExecutionException as a BuildFailedException OR if
   *      if --keep-going is set, suppress the interrupt and mark the build as
   *      failed and eventually raise a new BuildFailedException after all
   *      actions have been evaluated.
   *      Since the application still has not been notified of the SIGINT, it
   *      has no idea that a request to stop has been made.
   *
   * And then in both cases:
   *
   * (6)  The shutdownThreadPool method waits for all subprocesses to
   *      terminate, whether abruptly or normally.  This can take several
   *      seconds.  If the user is impatient and delivers additional signals to
   *      the JVM, these are delivered to the subprocesses, and additional
   *      interrupts are posted to the thread, again in no particular order.
   *
   *      It's important to note that in client/server mode, the Blaze client
   *      will send a SIGINT to the server the first two times it receives
   *      a SIGINT. The third time, however, it will send a SIGKILL.
   *      This way we allow users to work around "stuck" tests or genrules
   *
   *
   * For further reading about UNIX signals and process-groups, see "Advanced
   * Programming in the UNIX Environment", W. Richard Stephens.  For
   * information about Java thread interrupts, see the documentation at
   * java.lang.Thread, and also
   * http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp05236.html.
