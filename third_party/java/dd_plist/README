Description:

dd-plist
This library enables Java applications to work with property lists in various
formats.

You can parse existing property lists (e.g. those created by an iOS application)
and work with the contents on any operating system.

The library also enables you to create your own property lists from scratch and
store them in various formats.

The provided API mimics the Cocoa/NeXTSTEP API, granting access to the basic
functions of classes like NSDictionary, NSData, etc.

dd-plist has full support for the Android operating system. Consequently this
library can be of great help when it comes to porting iOS apps to Android.

Local Modifications:

NSNumber values now carry around their original string representation, so
strings that are "helpfully" converted to NSNumber (backed by primitive double)
will still be preserved. - https://code.google.com/p/plist/issues/detail?id=50


Do not throw an exception when creating a String based on the first 8 bytes of a
plist file when the file is smaller than 8 bytes. -
