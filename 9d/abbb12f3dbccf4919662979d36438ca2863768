Incompatible changes:

  - The $(ANDROID_CPU) Make variable is not available anymore. Use
    $(TARGET_CPU) after an Android configuration transition instead.
  - The $(JAVA_TRANSLATIONS) Make variable is not supported anymore.
  - Skylark structs (using struct()) may no longer have to_json and
    to_proto overridden.
  - The mobile-install --skylark_incremental_res flag is no longer
    available, use the --skylark flag instead.

New features:

  - android_local_test now takes advantage of Robolectric's binary
    resource processing which allows for faster tests.
  - Allow @ in package names.

Important changes:

  - Option --glibc is removed, toolchain selection relies solely on
    --cpu and --compiler options.
  - Build support for enabling cross binary FDO optimization.
  - The --distdir option is no longer experimental. This
      option allows to specify additional directories to look for
      files before trying to fetch them from the network. Files from
      any of the distdirs are only used if a checksum for the file
      is specified and both, the filename and the checksum, match.
  - Java coverage works now with multiple jobs.
  - Flip default value of --experimental_shortened_obj_file_path to
    true, Bazel now generates short object file path by default.
  - New rules for importing Android dependencies:
    `aar_import_external` and `aar_maven_import_external`.
    `aar_import_external` enables specifying external AAR
    dependencies using a list of HTTP URLs for the artifact.
    `aar_maven_import_external` enables specifying external AAR
    dependencies using the artifact coordinate and a list of server
    URLs.
  - The BAZEL_JAVAC_OPTS environment variable allows arguments, e.g.,
    "-J-Xmx2g", may be passed to the javac compiler during bootstrap
    build. This is helpful if your system chooses too small of a max
    heap size for the Java compiler during the bootstrap build.
  - --noexpand_configs_in_place is deprecated.
  - A tool to parse the Bazel execution log.
  - Support for LIPO has been fully removed.
  - Remove support for --discard_actions_after_execution.
  - Add --materialize_param_files flag to write parameter files even
    when actions are executed remotely.
  - Windows default system bazelrc is read from the user's
    ProgramData if present.
  - --[no]allow_undefined_configs no longer exists, passing undefined
    configs is an error.
